            <h1>About Bunkercoin</h1>
        <p>
            Bunkercoin, a new, stupid cryptocurrency! Made as a joke and for fun. It is a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, although it does not use SHA256 as its proof of work (POW). Taking development cues from Dogecoin and Bitcoin, Bunkercoin currently employs a simplified
            variant of the Scrypt algorithm. The block time is currently set to 60 seconds (1 minute if your can't count) and the difficulty retarget is calculated by DigiShield. <a href="https://dgbwiki.com/index.php?title=DigiShield" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer">You can
                find more info about it at the DigiByte documentation.</a>
            <br><br>There can exist approximately 100,000,000,000 bunkercoins. Each subsequent block will grant a random amount of coins to encourage miners to continue to secure the network and make up for lost wallets on hard drives/lost encryption
            passwords/etc. The block rewards are fixed and halve every 100,000 blocks. Starting with the 600,000th block, a permanent reward of 10,000 Bunkercoin per block will be paid. To learn more about <a href="//github.com/bunkercoin-project/bunkercoin#how-to-get-bunkercoin"
